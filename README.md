ReaderEase helps you read faster with more focus. Sentence-by-sentence emphasis guides your attention and minimizes the sensation of text overwhelm. Read at your own pace or auto-scroll at a speed you choose. Accentuate the keywords in each sentence to avoid distraction from filler words. Highlight important sentences for later reference. For both deep and speed reading, ReaderEase can help you learn more in less time.
